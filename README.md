- DreamAble is an AR-based web app specifically designed for people with impairments. The app helps users overcome their physical limitations and provides an immersive experience to explore the world around them
- Problem Statement :
People with mobility impairments often face unique challenges when it comes to interior design. Traditional approaches to design may not take into account the specific needs and preferences of this demographic, leading to frustration and dissatisfaction with the end result.

Our app aims to address this problem by providing a platform that is specifically tailored to the needs of differently-abled users. By leveraging AR technology, we can create a more intuitive and user-friendly experience that empowers users to take control of their living spaces.
